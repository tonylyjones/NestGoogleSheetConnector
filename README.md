# NestGoogleSheetConnector

A Google Sheet integration for NestJs.

# Installation

To use this module you will need:

- create a Google Cloud service account
- install the module
- provide the module with the credentials of the google cloud service account
- provide permissions to your service account on the spreadsheets you want to manipulate

## Create a Google Cloud service account

1. Access the [Google APIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) **while logged into your Google account**.
2. Create a **new project** and give it a name.
   [Create a new project](https://robocorp.com/docs/static/build/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets/console-create-project.png)
3. Click on `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES`.
   [Enable Google Sheets API](https://robocorp.com/docs/static/build/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets/enable-google-sheets-api.png)
4. Find and enable the `Google Sheet API`.
5. Create new credentials to the `Google Sheets API`. Select `Other UI` from the dropdown and select `Application Data`. Then click on the `What credentials do I need?` button.![Create credentials](https://robocorp.com/docs/static/build/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets/create-credentials.png)
6. On the next screen, choose a name for your service account, assign it a role of `Project`->`Editor`, and click `Continue`.![Create credentials step 2](https://robocorp.com/docs/static/build/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets/create-credentials-step2.png)
7. The credentials JSON file will be downloaded by your browser.

   > The credentials file allows anyone to access your cloud resources, so you should store it securely. [More information from Google](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#managing_service_account_keys).

8. Find the downloaded file and rename it to `service_account.json`.

## Install the module

```
npm install @tonylyjones/nest-google-sheet-connector
```

## Provide the module with the credentials of the google cloud service account

```ts
import { GoogleSheetModule } from "nest-google-sheet-connector"

@Module({
  imports: [
    GoogleSheetModule.register(credentials), // credentials is a JSON object downloaded from Google Cloud Platform
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Provide permissions to your service account on the spreadsheets you want to manipulate

1.  Create or select an existing Google Sheet.
2.  Open the `service_account.json` file and find the `client_email` property.
3.  Click on the `Share` button in the top right, and add the email address of the service account as an editor.![Add user as an editor](https://robocorp.com/docs/static/build/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets/spreadsheet-add-user-as-editor.png)

> If you want only to allow the account read access to the spreadsheet, assign it the `Viewer` role instead.

4. Take note of the ID of the Google Sheet document, which is contained in its URL, after the `/d` element. So, for example, if the URL of your document is `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1234567890123abcf/edit#gid=0`, the ID will be `1234567890123abcf`.

# Documentation

## Inject the service into a constructor

```ts
import { GoogleSheetConnectorService } from "../../lib/nest-google-sheet-connector"

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  constructor(
    private googleSheetConnectorService: GoogleSheetConnectorService
  ) {}
}
```

This service contain google sheet providers methods

## Troubleshooting

Google Cloud requires an SSL certificate for API requests.
Here is how to certify your local environment under NestJs:

1. Get your certificate

```
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
 -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
  printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

2. Modify the NestFactory in the src/main.ts file

```ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core"
import { AppModule } from "./app.module"

async function bootstrap() {
  const fs = require("fs")
  const keyFile = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/../localhost.key")
  const certFile = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/../localhost.crt")
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, {
    httpsOptions: {
      key: keyFile,
      cert: certFile,
    },
  })
  await app.listen(3000)
}
bootstrap()
```
